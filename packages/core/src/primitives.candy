public builtin class Never
/// Can never be created. It's still useful to specify that an expression will never return
/// directly. More specifically, this is the case in the following cases:
///
/// * An expression runs endlessly.
/// * An expression aborts the current control flow.
///
/// Here are a few examples for expressions that evaluate to `Never`:
///
/// * `return 5`
/// * `break`
/// * `throw "blub"`
/// * `loop {}`
///
/// There are no instances of `Never`. That's why we can claim that all (zero) instances can be
/// converted to all other types loslessly ‚Äì you can assign `Never` to anything:
/// `let a: Int = return 5` works, because the result of `return 5` is never created.
