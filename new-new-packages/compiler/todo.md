- StructField vs StructEntry
  -> field
- opinions on debugging using --debug and --watch?
  -> nice!
- errors
  - currently, only some text
    - all the natural language stuff scattered through the compiler, makes revising harder and obfuscates the actual compiler code
    - multiple modalities may require different formatting: IDE vs console vs runtime
  - proposal: CompilerError contains raw errors from compiler stages
  - don't abort if errors are contained; rather handle them during execution
    - vision: syntax error in some part -> can still compile to executable that crashes when it reaches that point
  -> put errors in the tree
