# Tuples are types that can hold multiple other types.
#
# They're kind of like a class, but without a name and without giving the fields names.
#
# There is nothing to see here, because tuples are actually built into the compiler. Just use
# parenthesis to create them on-the-fly:
#
# ```
# let a: (String, Int) = ("foo", 42)
# ```
