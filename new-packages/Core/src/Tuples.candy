# Tuples are types that can hold multiple other types.
#
# There is nothing to see here, because tuples are actually built into the compiler. Just use
# parenthesis to create them on-the-fly:
#
# ```
# let a: (String, Int) = ("foo", 42) # Positional tuple
# let b: (foo: String, bar: Int) = (foo: "foo", bar: 42) # Named tuple
# ```
