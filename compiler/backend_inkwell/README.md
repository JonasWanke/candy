# Candy Inkwell Compiler

This crate provides an LLVM-based backend for the Candy compiler
using the inkwell crate. It is highly experimental and still
doesn't support many of Candy's features.

## Requirements

You currently need to have LLVM 15 installed on your system. You also need to have the `llc` and `clang` commands available.
