# üç≠ Candy

A sweet programming language that is robust, minimalistic, and expressive.

Candy aims to have excellent tooling ‚Äì most language features are designed with tooling in mind.
Many languages have a strict separation between compile-time and runtime.
Candy blurs the line between those stages, for example, by replacing compile-time types with edit-time fuzzing.

## Quick introduction

* **Values are at the center of your computations.**
  Only a handful of predefined types of values exist:
  ```
  3                   # int
  "Candy"             # text
  Green               # symbol
  [ Name: "Candy" ]   # struct
  { it -> add it 2 }  # closure
  ```
* **Minimalistic syntax.**
  Defining variables and functions works without braces or keywords cluttering up your code.
  The syntax is indentation-aware.
  ```
  foo = 42
  println message =
    print message
    print "\n"
  println "Hello, world!"
  ```
* **Extensive compile-time evaluation.**
  Many values can already be computed at compile-time.
  In your editor, you'll see the results on the right side:
  ```
  foo = double 2  # foo = 4
  ```
* **Fuzzing instead of traditional types.**
  In Candy, functions have to specify their needs *exactly.*
  As you type, the tooling automatically tests your code with many input to see if one breaks the code:
  ```
  foo a =             # If you pass a = 0,
    needs (isInt a)
    math.logarithm a  # then this fails because logarithm only works on positive numbers.

  efficientTextReverse text =
    needs (isText text)
    needs (isPalindrome text) "efficientTextReverse only works on palindromes"
    text

  greetBackwards name =                   # If you pass name = "Test",
    "Hello, {efficientTextReverse name}"  # then this fails because efficientTextReverse only works on palindromes.
  ```

## The current state

We are currently implementing a first version of Candy in Rust.
We already have a language server that provides some tooling.

Major milestones:

* [x] build a basic parser
* [x] lower CST to AST
* [x] lower AST to HIR
* [x] build a basic interpreter
* [x] add CLI arguments for printing the CST, AST, or HIR
* [ ] make functions independent of their order in top-level scope
* [x] support importing other files (`use`)
* [x] namespaces/modules including visibility modifiers
* [ ] IDE support:
  * [ ] completion, completion resolve
  * [ ] hover
  * [ ] signatureHelp
  * [x] ~~declaration~~, definition, ~~typeDefinition~~
  * [ ] implementation
  * [x] references
  * [x] documentHighlight
  * [ ] documentSymbol
  * [ ] codeAction, codeAction resolve
  * [ ] codeLens, codeLens resolve, codeLens refresh
  * [ ] documentLink, documentLink resolve
  * [x] ~~documentColor, colorPresentation~~
  * [ ] formatting
  * [ ] rangeFormatting
  * [ ] onTypeFormatting
  * [ ] rename, prepareRename
  * [x] foldingRange
  * [ ] selectionRange
  * [ ] prepareCallHierarchy
  * [ ] callHierarchy incoming, callHierarchy outgoing
  * [x] semantic tokens
  * [x] ~~linkedEditingRange~~
  * [ ] moniker
* [x] incremental compilation

* [x] auto-fuzzing
* [ ] "type" proofs
* [ ] testing
* [ ] fuzzing of the compiler itself
* [ ] clean up repo (delete a bunch of stuff!)
* [ ] package manager
* [ ] online playground

## Short-term TODOs

- fix fault attribution
- new name?
- add caching while compile-time evaluating code
- tags
- pattern matching
- pipe operator
- add CI
- add tests
- add a more lightweight tracer that only tracks stack traces
- text interpolation
- optimize: eliminate common subtrees
- optimize: inline functions
- minimize inputs found through fuzzing
- fuzz parser
- remove builtinPrint
- optimize: tail call optimization

- tracing visualization
- distinguish packages from normal modules
- complain about comment lines with too much indentation
- develop guidelines about how to format reasons

## How to use Candy

1. Install Rust.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open the workspace in VS Code.
4. In the VS Code settings (JSON), add the following: `"candy.languageServerCommand": "cargo run --manifest-path <path-to-the-candy-folder>/compiler/Cargo.toml -- lsp",`.
5. Run `npm install` inside `vscode_extension/`.
6. Run the launch config ‚ÄúRun Extension (VS Code Extension)‚Äù.
7. In the new VS Code window that opens, you can enjoy üç≠¬†Candy :)
